bug: 
sometimes contract source code solidity versions differ within imports, causing compiler bug
according to nomiclabs foundation it is not fixable without changing pragmas

solution must be new implementation:
rewrite this project entirely in solidity instead using bytecode and assembly for deployment
(would need foundry for this)
